The files in .../f90 come from:
https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/hermite_cubic/hermite_cubic.html

The original library has been modified to agree with f90 code.
The fortran static library can be generated by hermite_cubic.sh, which
provides also the test to verify non-regression with respect to the version
from the website.

Please, see the corresponding webpages for additional information.

wrapper.sh produces the python modules.
