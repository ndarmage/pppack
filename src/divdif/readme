The files in .../f90 come from:
http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/divdif/divdif.html

The original library has been modified to agree with f90 code. The fortran static library can be generated by divdif.sh, which provides also the test to verify non-regression with respect to the version from the website.

Please, see the corresponding webpages for additional information.

wrapper.sh produces the python modules.
