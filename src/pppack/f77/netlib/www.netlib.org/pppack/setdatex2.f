      subroutine setdat(icount)
c  from  * a practical guide to splines *  by c. de boor    
c  to be called in main program  l 2 m a i n .
c     this routine is set up to provide the specific data for example 2
c     in chapter xiv. for a general purpose l2-approximation program, it
c     would have to be replaced by a subroutine reading in
c           ntau, tau(i), gtau(i), i=1,...,ntau
c     and reading in or setting
c            k, l, break(i),i=1,...,l+1,  and weight(i),i=1,...,ntau,
c           as well as  totalw = sum( weight(i) , i=1,...,ntau).
c    i c o u n t  is equal to zero when setdat is called in  l 2 m a i n
c     for the first time. after that, it is up to setdat to use icount
c     for keeping track of the passes through setdat . this is important
c     since l2main relies on setdat for  t e r m i n a t i o n .
