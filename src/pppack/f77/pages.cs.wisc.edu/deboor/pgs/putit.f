      subroutine putit ( t, kpm, left, scrtch, dbiatx, q, nrow, b )
c  from  * a practical guide to splines *  by c. de Boor (7 may 92)    
calls  bsplvd(bsplvb),difequ(*)
c  to be called by  e q b l o k .
c
c  puts together one block of the collocation equation system
c
c******  i n p u t  ******
c  t     knot sequence, of size  left+kpm (at least)
c  kpm   order of spline
c  left  integer indicating interval of interest, viz the interval
c           (t(left), t(left+1))
c  nrow  number of rows in block to be put together
c
c******  w o r k  a r e a  ******
c  scrtch   used in bsplvd, of size (kpm,kpm)
c  dbiatx   used to contain derivatives of b-splines, of size (kpm,m+1)
c           with dbiatx(j,i+1) containing the i-th derivative of the
c           j-th b-spline of interest
c
c******  o u t p u t  ******
c  q  the block, of size (nrow,kpm)
c  b  the corresponding piece of the right side, of size (nrow)
c
c******  m e t h o d  ******
c  the  k  collocation equations for the interval  (t(left),t(left+1))
c  are constructed with the aid of the subroutine  d i f e q u ( 2, .,
c  . ) and interspersed (in order) with the side conditions (if any) in
c  this interval, using  d i f e q u ( 3, ., . )  for the information.
c     the block  q  has  kpm  columns, corresponding to the  kpm  b-
c  splines of order  kpm  which have the interval (t(left),t(left+1))
c  in their support. the block's diagonal is part of the diagonal of the
c  total system. the first equation in this block not overlapped by the
c  preceding block is therefore equation  l o w r o w , with lowrow = 1+
c  number of side conditions in preceding intervals (or blocks).

c        the next equation, a collocation equation (mode = 2) or a side

c        in terms of the info supplied by  difequ . the corresponding
c        equation for the b-coeffs of  f  therefore has the left side of
c        (*), evaluated at each of the  kpm  b-splines having  xx  in
