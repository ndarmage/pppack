calls  bsplvb
c
      integer ia,left
      real biatx(4),t(11),values(4),x
c                 knot sequence set here....
      data t / 4*0.,1.,3.,4.,4*6. /
      do 20 ia=1,40
         x = float(ia)/5. - 1.
         do 10 left=4,7
            call bsplvb ( t, 4, 1, x, left, biatx )
c
c           according to  bsplvb  listing,  biatx(.) now contains value
c           at  x  of polynomial which agrees on the interval  (t(left),
c           t(left+1) )  with the b-spline  b(left-4 + . ,4,t) . hence,
c           biatx(8-left)  now contains value of that polynomial for
c           b(left-4 +(8-left) ,4,t) = b(4,4,t) . since this b-spline
c           has support  (t(4),t(8)), it makes sense to run  left = 4,
c           ...,7, storing the resulting values in  values(1),...,
c           values(4)  for later printing.
c
   10       values(left-3) = biatx(8-left)
   20    print 620, x, values
  620 format(f10.1,4f20.8)
                                        stop
