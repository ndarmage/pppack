The files in .../f77 come from http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~deboor/pgs/ and http://www.netlib.org.
They are publicly available, thanks to C. De Boor. They are downloaded by:
wget -m -p -E -k -K -np  http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~deboor/pgs/
(or http://www.netlib.org/pppack)

(for the fortran files only, use: wget --accept f,dt,dt1,dt2,dt3 -m -p -E -k -K -np  http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~deboor/pgs/)

The files in src/f90 come from:
http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/pppack/pppack.html

The original library has been modified to agree with f90 code (pppack_mod.f90), by placing common data block in modules. The fortran static library can be generated by pppack.sh, which provides also the test to verify non-regression with respect to the version from the website.

Please, see the corresponding webpages for additional information.

wrapper.sh produces the python module too.
