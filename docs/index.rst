==================================
Welcome to PPPACK's documentation!
==================================


PPPACK is a Python module for piece-wise polynomial and B-spline multivariate approximations. The name follows from the main FORTRAN90 extension used for numerical computation, the library pppack.f90 originally started by John Burkhardt on previous FORTRAN77 code from Carl De Boor.
