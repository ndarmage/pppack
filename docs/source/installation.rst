Installation
============

PPPACK is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pppack/>`_, so use pip to install the package as:

.. code-block:: bash
  
   pip install pppack

To fork a development version from GitHub, use:

.. code-block:: bash
  
   git clone git://github.com/ndarmage/pppack

Then, an editable install (by ``pip install -e pppack``) is suggested to work in a collaborative framework.

To build only the Fortran extension in the package directory, execute:

.. code-block:: bash
  
   python setup.py build_src build_ext --inplace --fcompiler=gnu95

By altering the input of the argument ``--fcompiler``, user can choose a different Fortran compiler for building the extension.

The documentation can be generated by Sphinx in ``docs/``, for instance by ``make html`` and serving the page ``docs/_build/html/index.html`` in any browser. If no git repository is cloned, refer to `ReadTheDocs.org <http://pppack.readthedocs.io>`_ for the documentation.
